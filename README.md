# Databricks_MLOPS

An end-to-end **MLOps workflow using Databricks**, demonstrating how to train, evaluate, and operationalize machine learning models with a clean, automation-ready structure.

This repository is designed as a **practical reference** for building and running ML pipelines on Databricks, suitable for learning, experimentation, and extension to production-grade systems.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Build a reproducible ML training pipeline on Databricks  
- Demonstrate MLOps best practices (structure, dependencies, automation readiness)  
- Enable easy execution via Databricks notebooks and jobs  
- Serve as a base template for future ML deployment workflows
